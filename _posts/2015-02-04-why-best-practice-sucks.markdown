**Spend any amount of time browsing the web and you’re sure to notice the similarities between websites. The likeness of designs is even more evident when you hone in on one industry at a time. So why is this? Has the winning solution been locked down? Has someone found just the right formula and everyones jumping on that train? If only!**

The truth is that too many trends are mistaken as the key to delivering conversion uplift. “Hey, look at Apple – they’re doing it like that so why aren’t we?!”. Of course it’s hugely important to be aware of how web design is progressing but the real danger lies in blindly adopting designs and layouts under the assumption that they are “best practice”.

**What’s so bad about “best practice”?**

Let’s consider the perils of blindly taking design “inspiration” from your competitors. Unless you’ve got an Edward Snowden in their office then it’s probable you have no idea of the following:

- How is there website performing? How does their conversion compare to yours?
- How does their business environment differ from yours?
- How do their goals compare?
- Are you even targeting the same audience?
- You get the idea – pretty tricky to tell if that fancy scrolling thing they’re doing is actually paying off. Take an example from a different industry and the list of unknowns gets a whole lot longer!

**So how do I beat “best practice”?**

How do you find out what’s best for you? Test it!

Seen someone using a CTA you think might work? Test it. Not sure if a carousel is for you? Test it. Differing opinions on your teams about your new designs? TEST THEM! Take the guesswork out of your design and put it to your customers.

Recently, I ran a series of controlled tests on CTA wording – hardly the most radical of changes but still a hot topic of conversation for us. Much to my delight we were able to deliver double digit conversion uplift to our primary sales journey and we now have a better understanding of how CTA copy affects our conversion. I’d love to share detailed results but the truth is that it would be pointless! What works for one company will not necessarily transfer across to another.

**The Takeaway**

Your business has a unique set of challenges and goals – controlled testing will help you build a tailored solution which maximises your conversion as well deepening your understanding of your customers behaviour. That’s got to be good right?
