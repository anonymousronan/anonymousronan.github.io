**Earlier this year I decided to start dipping my toe into the world of development. I don’t necessarily buy into the “designers *need* to code” school of thought but I do strongly believe it makes life a lot easier to have an understanding of the medium I design for. More to the point I like making stuff so writing a bit of code naturally interests me.**

There’s a million and one different resources to get started but below are those which I found most useful. Remember, this is aimed at beginners so others may find these glaringly obvious :-)

[Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) - an excellent site with free courses to get started on HTML, CSS, JS, PHP etc. Brilliantly designed courses which nudge you nicely along with practical examples. 

[Codepen](http://codepen.io/) - this one serves two purposes. Firstly, it provides a perfect code editor with live visual output and an array of other useful features. With a Pro account I can hide my noob pens :-) Secondly, it’s a fantastic place to get into the nuts and bolts of other folk’s work. Great site for inspiration.

[Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) - a question and answer site for all things code. I can’t overstate how useful this site has been. Standard of answers is generally A1 - saved my bacon multiple times.

[CSS Animation](https://cssanimation.rocks/) - does what it says on the tin. Fantastic site and course to learn about CSS animation. I’ve found this invaluable for breathing life into work without needing to immediately resort to Javascript.

[Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/) - free courses to get started with jQuery. Going through these at the moment. Very well explained in bite size chunks.

[CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - blog on CSS stuff. Some really useful explainers and also good for keeping up to date on industry topics.

[Shop Talk Show](http://shoptalkshow.com/) - one of my go to design and development podcasts when I’m in need of some time away from screens. 

[Codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops/) - site with code tutorials and plenty of inspiration to boot. The CSS reference guide here is definitely worth a bookmark.

There's lots more fantastic resources out there, but these are the ones currently sitting at the top of my bookmarks. Feel free to drop me a tweet if there are any sites you think I've missed out on!'

Until next time – Cheers,
