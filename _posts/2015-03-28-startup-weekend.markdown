**54 hours to develop a business idea. Impossible, right? That’s what I thought too. Nonetheless the format behind Startup Weekend has always fascinated me, from the 60 second pitches to the instant formation of teams from a group of total strangers. When I saw SW Limerick was coming up again I jumped at the chance to get involved. When it comes to Startups I’m a total beginner, so what follows is some (hopefully) useful tips to get the most from a Startup Weekend.**

**Friday Evening**

Mingle. Seriously! Take the opportunity to get to know everyone and maybe even do some networking – lots of folks pop in for the kickoff so you never know who you might bump into.

*Pitches*

If you’ve got an idea, anything at all, get off your arse and pitch it! 60 seconds is all you’ve got and it’s over before you know it. I didn’t have the next big thing this time but seeing how painless the pitches are, I wouldn’t hesitate next time round. Be short and to the point. Who are, what’s your idea and who do you need to make it happen?

*The Hustle*

If you’ve got an idea that needs votes you better hustle hard! I’ve never seen anything as competitive. Sell that idea and sell it fast!

*The Hustle Part Deux*

Time to form teams – again get your hustle on, talk to that team you’re passionate about (quickly!) and be honest about what you can add to the team or what you need for your own team.

**Saturday**

Hopefully by this stage, you’ve found some nice workspace. Before you do anything, make sure every team member is on the same page. Define your business goals and nail them to the wall if needs be! Two absolutely crucial questions – what problem are you solving and who are you solving it for?

Saturday is where the donkey work is done. Some points to help you out:

1. *Define a solid business plan.* Some of what this should inform:
- Who is your target market?
- How will you monetise your idea?
- What is your USP?
- What is your customer acquisition strategy?
<br>

2. *Validate, validate and validate again.* Talk to your target market, get real validation from real people. This is crucial for the judging and sorts the blue sky ideas from potential moneymakers. (Thanks to @patphelan and @kierannormoyle amongst nearly 70 others for helping us out here.)

3. *Listen to the mentors.* Again, this sounds obvious but each mentor has a unique angle from their extensive experience. It’s up to you to pull out the takeaway points from each session and use it steer your idea in the right direction. Remember, don’t marry your idea. Take critical feedback onboard but not to heart! Use it to iterate and improve your idea.

4. *Minimum Viable Product* – you will NOT build the 100% finished product in 54 hours. Focus on the MVP to prove your idea is a runner. Descope edge cases to keep the project moving forward. Here's an example of the UI I created for the profile search and compare page.

**Sunday**

Final pitch day. Spend the morning creating/tidying up your presentation and spend as much of your remaining time practising your pitch as possible. You’ve got 5 minutes to pitch which flies so you can never practice too much, trust me!  We had some great guidance from Ed Fidgeon Kavanagh/[@clearpreso](https://twitter.com/Clearpreso) of Clear Presentation Design which proved really useful – thanks Ed! It was great to hear the judges so passionate about the whole event and see the support from well established entrepreneurs.

Regardless of whether your idea wins or not, enjoy the rollercoaster journey. You’re part of a unique community challenging the traditional methods of entrepreneurial education whilst stepping out of your own comfort zone and hopefully learning lots along the way.

Special mention to the following coaches who really pushed us to consider every aspect of our idea:

[@GillianBarry](https://twitter.com/GillianBarry), [@genemurphy](https://twitter.com/genemurphy), [@_helencousins](https://twitter.com/_helencousins), [@DavidGQuaid](https://twitter.com/DavidGQuaid), [@skehillr](https://twitter.com/skehillr), [@clearpreso](https://twitter.com/Clearpreso). Apologies if I’ve missed anyone :)

To all of the organising team who made it possible – the setup was really, really impressive! Great job folks! And of course the hostess with the mostess, Andrei (@andreim123) – good job sir!

Until next time – Cheers,
