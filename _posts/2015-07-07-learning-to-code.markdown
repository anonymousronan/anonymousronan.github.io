There's so many great podcasts, blogs and books doing the rounds at the moment. This week I had a chance to catch up on a few of them before my holidays are done and I'm back to the grind!

**Must read:** 

[Design is a job](http://abookapart.com/products/design-is-a-job) - *Mike Monteiro* 

This has been on the reading list for quite a while. Regardless of whether you're a designer working inhouse, agency or freelance there is something for you in this book. Even if your not a designer, I'm sure there is value in this one for you. If audiobooks are your thing, this is just over 4 hours and makes for an easy listen - filled with golden tips!

**Must listen:**

[Shop Talk Show Episode 172 with Tim Brown](http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/172-with-tim-brown/)

Tim Brown is the Type Manager with Adobe Typekit. In this episode Tim shares lots of typography knowledge bombs and insight into the effort involved in creating some of the webs most used typefaces. Check out practice.typekit.com for lots more great typography stuff.

[Inside Intercom with Peter Merholz](https://soundcloud.com/intercom/inside-intercom-podcast-peter-merholz)

This one is actually a month old but I stumbled across it this week. Peter Merholz is currently Senior Director of Design with Jawbone. In this episode Des Traynor chats Product Design with Peter, what makes a Product Manager and the idea of design as a "centralized partnership".

Got something worth a read or listen? I'd love to know about it! Drop me a tweet :-)

Until next time â€“ Cheers,
