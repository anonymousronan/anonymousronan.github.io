    <div class="about-me-right"><p>I’m a UX designer, a UI designer and a general maker of stuff. Driven by a deep empathy for people and problems around me I believe in building experiences that matter. I believe great design is invisible and products which integrate seamlessly to my life make me tick.</p><p>Deep down, I’m a data nerd so I’m passionate about combining qualitative user research with quantitative analytics data to inform design and believe strongly in delivering features with a measurable commercial impact.</p></div>

<div class="about-extra-left"><h4>About this site</h4><br><p>This year I made it my mission to learn more about the medium I design for. I've built this site from the ground up using HTML, CSS, a bit of Markdown and a touch of Jquery all pushed to a Ruby based Jekyll set up. For my fellow typography lovers I went for a font called <a href="http://www.bariol.com/">Bariol.</a></p></div>

  <div class="about-extra-right"><h4>Experience</h4><br><p>It's been an exciting journey getting to where I am today. Driven by curiosity I’ve throughly enjoyed becoming a self-taught designer. Since graduating from University of Limerick in 2010 with an honours business degree I've worked in the telecommunications industry delivering exceptional customer experiences.</p></div>
